Description: In this workshop, we will use R/Bioconductor packages to
	     explore, process, visualise and understand mass
	     spectrometry-based proteomics data, starting with raw
	     data, and proceeding with identification and quantitation
	     data, discussing some of their peculiarities compared to
	     sequencing data along the way. The participants will gain
	     a general overview of Bioconductor packages for mass
	     spectrometry and proteomics, and learn how to navigate
	     raw data and reconstruct quantitative data. The workshop
	     is aimed at a beginner to intermediate level, such as,
	     for example, seasoned R users who want to get started
	     with mass spectrometry and proteomics, or proteomics
	     practitioners who want to familiarise themselves with R
	     and Bioconductor infrastructure.
